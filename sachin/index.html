								Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand. He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. cricinfo columnist sambit bal has described him as the &#34;most wholesome batsman of his time&#34;.
						<br>		<br> His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.<br><br>
						He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that&#34;it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does &#34;.Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.
